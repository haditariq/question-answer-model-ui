The task is to implement a frontend for a question-answering tool, just as the one that we provide at https://dida.do/question-answering. The idea of such a tool is to answer any kind of question by a machine learning model regarding any given input text. The answer is then a text span in the original text that highlights the part that is relevant for the given question. For the implementation you can for instance use a modern frontend framework such as Vue, React, Svelte etc. As a machine learning model, we suggest relying on a Hugging Face model (https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2) which can be “fed” with the text and the question as an input. You can also choose a different model if it suits the requirements better. Please read up some of the desired data formats yourself, e.g. on the Hugging Face website. Regarding the layout, you do not need to copy the exact one from the dida website and creativity is always welcome. Also, if you have ideas for further features (both in terms of design and functionality), feel free to integrate them. The entire task should not take you more than half a day – if it does, it is also fine to send a preliminary version of your code and let us know how you would proceed. Have fun coding!
